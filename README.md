# MTLTranslate
A python script that uses Selenium to scrape Machine-Translated novels from sites and improve the grammar and readability using OpenAI API. The text is then exported to a word document to be read.


# Development Plan
1. A script that scrapes machine-translated text from websites and splits them into paragraphs.
2. Script will be updated to run through OpenAI's API which will fix the grammar and readability of the text.
    - This finished text will be exported to a word document for easy reading
3. Update to allow reading of a database which includes document titles and the corresponding websites.
    - The text will then be mass-exported to a folder for continuous reading
